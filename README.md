# Numbers

[Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci_sequence.py) - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number

[Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Text/fizz_buzz.py) - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”

[Converter](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/tree/master/Numbers/Converter%20to%20US%20units%20ipywidgets) - converting from metric to imperial and vice versa(length, weight, temperature), visualisation by ipywidgets
