# Numbers

[Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci_sequence.py) - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number

[Converter metric and imperial GUI ipywidgets](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/tree/master/Numbers/Converter%20to%20US%20units%20ipywidgets) - converting from metric to imperial and vice versa(length, weight, temperature), visualisation by ipywidgets

[Next Prime Number](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/next_prime_number.py) - ask for next number is prime or not. Optimized - looking only for dividers not more sqrt of number and only in list of prime numbers

[Find PI to the Nth Digit](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Find%20PI%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit.py) - Get the value of Pi to n number of decimal places by Chudnovsky Algorithm

[Find e to the Nth Digit](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Find%20e%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit.py) - Get the value of e to n number of decimal places

[Prime Factorization](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Prime%20Factorization.py) - Python program to find prime factors in list

[Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Find%20Cost%20of%20Tile%20to%20Cover%20W%20x%20H%20Floor.py) - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user

[Mortgage Calculator](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Mortgage%20Calculator.py) - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage
over given Nth terms at a given interest rate.

[Change Return Program](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Change%20Return%20Program.py) - The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change

[Binary to Decimal and Back Converter](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Binary%20to%20Decimal%20and%20Back%20Converter.py) - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent

[Alarm-Clock and Timer GUI tkinter](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Alarm-Clock%20and%20Timer%20GUI%20tkinter.py) - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time. GUI on tkinter

[Distance Between Two Cities geocoder](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Distance%20Between%20Two%20Cities.py) - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude

[Credit Card Validator Luhn algorithms](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Credit%20Card%20Validator.py)-Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum). Using Luhn algorithms and MOD 10 checksums

# Text

[Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Text/fizz_buzz.py) - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”
