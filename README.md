# Numbers

[Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/fibonacci_sequence.py) - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number

[Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Text/fizz_buzz.py) - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”

[Converter](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/tree/master/Numbers/Converter%20to%20US%20units%20ipywidgets) - converting from metric to imperial and vice versa(length, weight, temperature), visualisation by ipywidgets

[Next Prime Number](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/next_prime_number.py) - ask for next number is prime or not. Optimized - looking only for dividers not more sqrt of number and only in list of prime numbers

[Find PI to the Nth Digit](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Find%20PI%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit.py) - Get the value of Pi to n number of decimal places by Chudnovsky Algorithm

[Find e to the Nth Digit](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Find%20e%20to%20the%20Nth%20Digit.py) - Get the value of e to n number of decimal places

[Prime Factorization](https://github.com/mufteevir/learnpython/blob/master/Numbers/Prime%20Factorization.py) - Python program to find prime factors in list
